JDBC Interview Q&A - Student-style answers

1. What is JDBC?
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API in Java to connect and interact with databases using SQL.

2. What is PreparedStatement?
PreparedStatement is a JDBC interface that allows parameterized SQL queries and helps prevent SQL injection. It can be reused with different parameters.

3. Difference between Statement and PreparedStatement?
- Statement: used for simple, static SQL. Prone to SQL injection.
- PreparedStatement: precompiled SQL with parameters, safer and often faster for repeated queries.

4. How do you handle SQL exceptions?
Use try-catch blocks to catch SQLException and handle or log the error. Always close resources in finally or use try-with-resources.

5. How to prevent SQL Injection?
Use PreparedStatement with parameter placeholders (?) and avoid building SQL by concatenating user input.

6. What is JDBC DriverManager?
DriverManager is a class that manages JDBC drivers and provides the getConnection(...) method to obtain DB connections.

7. How to close connections?
Use try-with-resources or call close() on ResultSet, Statement, and Connection in finally block to ensure they are closed.

8. What is a ResultSet?
ResultSet is an object returned by executing a SELECT query; it allows iterating over rows and reading column values.

9. What is auto-commit in JDBC?
Auto-commit means each SQL statement is automatically committed. You can disable it with setAutoCommit(false) to manage transactions manually.

10. How to connect Java to MySQL?
- Add MySQL JDBC driver to classpath.
- Use DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://host:port/database", "user", "pass");
- Use Statement/PreparedStatement to run queries.
